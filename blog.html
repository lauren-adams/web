            <p class="card-text">
                I love heist movies; they are a wonderful and severely underrated form of cinema. I think cinema as a whole would be better if more movies were heists. I will now rank films on a scale of 1 - 10 for their heistness:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:</strong> 4.1243
                    <p>
                        This film is not a heist and therefore cannot be rated particularly highly. But there is an attempted heist to get the Sorcerer's Stone. Because of this and the multiple levels of security needed to get the stone, it will receive a ranking higher than 3. Unfortunately, the stone was in his pocket the whole time, so nothing was heisted, leaving the film at a 4.1243.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ocean's Eleven:</strong> 9.635
                    <p>
                        Wonderful film. So much heist. Such a classic. The whole film is centered around a heist while still being fun, and the heist is significantly complete and wonderful.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>National Treasure:</strong> 5
                    <p>
                        The Declaration of Independence was stolen, and that was great. Unfortunately, it only went downhill after that. Little else was heisted, more of just a historical smash and grab, leaving us at a 5.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Star Wars: A New Hope:</strong> 2.0001
                    <p>
                        This film is utterly lacking in heist. At best, they heisted Leia out of space jail, but that is not so much of a heist rather than a prison break, so a solid 2.0001.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ant-Man:</strong> 8
                    <p>
                        This film was a masterpiece. A wonderful fusion of the genres of superhero and heist and proof that superhero films can be more than just CGI fight scenes. Truly one of a kind, it should have paved the way for more super-heists, but alas Marvel disappointed. Also, Paul Rudd is just wonderful.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ant-Man: Quantumania</strong> 0.9
                    <p>
                        This film was a true disappointment. Going into the theater, all I wanted was a good heist, but all I received was disappointment. It receives almost a point for almost heisting a thing out of a quantum place, but there was no planning or security or heist. This is a pity point, out of respect for Paul Rudd.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit:</strong> 6.789
                    <p>
                        I have not seen this franchise fully, but I do know a ring gets stolen in various capacities which really feels like the makings of a heist. For these reasons, I am giving it a hopeful 6.789 but may need to adjust this later in life.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Aladdin:</strong> 3
                    <p>
                        This film could have been a wonderful heist as the main character is a thief. He does successfully steal the lamp, so he gets a 3, but it is simply too much of a theft rather than a heist. So, I cannot in good conscience give it any higher rating.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Wizard of Oz:</strong> 2.2222
                    <p>
                        This film is not particularly heisty, although it does have elements of assembling a team to break into a building, and Dorothy does steal some shoes off a witch's corpse, demonstrating her capacity to commit acts of theft. But once again, this is simply more petty crime than heist.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Now You See Me:</strong> 10
                    <p>
                        This film combines the elements of magic with heist to make a wonderful combination. The specialized heisters have unique skills not utilized in other heist films. I feel the magic/theft elements and well-orchestrated heists elevate this film beyond just a classic heist and into the 10 ranking.
                    </p>

              <img src="https://i0.wp.com/thefutureoftheforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disney-Live-Action-Remakes.jpg?w=1920&ssl=1" alt="Hello">
            </div>
            <p class="card-text">The Disney franchise has held tight to the hearts of children and families for the past 100 years. They boast a lineup of iconic princess stories, world-class theme parks, and animation that paved the way to modern cinema. Plus they continued to buy up any franchise that could threaten their empire, including Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and even National Geographic. With all of this going for them, why have they consistently disappointed fans?</p>

            <p>I believe the heart of this problem is the live-action remake. They provide a safe opportunity for studios to re-release a character for the younger generation and provide an easy cash grab. But they don't add anything. Maleficent was a great film that was cool and told a new story from an existing framework. But Cinderella, Belle, Aladdin, and Mulan all proved to be forgettable and controversial films.</p>
            
            <p>I wouldn't spend money to go and see an autotuned animation-heavy shot-for-shot remake of a story I have already seen. Furthermore, some scenes don't need realism. We don't need emotionless CGI lions recreating The Lion King or a terrifying CGI Flounder. Animation has charm and magic and is stylistic and beautiful. Just because we can doesn't mean we should.</p>
            
            <p>Also, we need to address the political controversy of finding live-action actors to replace beloved animated characters. No live-action casting has been without controversy, from Ariel to even Nani for the live-action Lilo and Stitch. It appears no actor can make the public happy. It is either an actor that is not the correct ethnicity or is the correct ethnicity but does not look like the character or is swapping the race of a character in a way that does not add anything to the plot. All of this controversy just feels frustrating and toxic for the poor actors who are put in these environments. These actors don't need to have to live up to an unreasonable fanbase when Disney could just create new content.</p>
            
            <p>There is no need to recreate exsisting films if the goal is to incoorperate more diversity; write authentic and diverse stories that fit new characters. New films like Encanto, Coco, and The Wish show that Disney can captivate audiences with beautiful and diverse new stories rather than just regurgitating already beloved stories.</p>
            
            <p>Yes, it is more of a gamble to release original stories, and they might bomb, but Disney has a ton of money that could be funneled into new films and animation rather than remakes. And there are so many wonderful fairy tales and folktales that could be turned into wonderful films that could captivate the next generations. Films like Frozen, Moana, Inside Out, and Zootopia were all loved because they were different and wonderful. There might be some bombs like Strange World or Turning Red, but at least they tried. It is better to try and fail than not try at all. Anyway, that is my brain dump. Be better, Disney. Thanks!</p>

            <h2 class="card-title custom-green">Estonia Adventures</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> I didn't expect to become a travel blogger this summer, but I really need to finish this blog page, and I have not slept since I was in Estonia, and everyone is telling me to write things down so I remember it, so these are my thoughts:</p>

            <p>
                All the adults were hyping up Estonia, so I knew it would be cool for a country I had never thought about, but wow was it amazing. We trained for like eight hours and booked it across the city on a tram because I definitely did not give us enough time... But we docked around 9:30, and Rachel's dance friend Mia met us there. 
                Mia was literally such an incredible tour guide and person. She moved from Houston to Estonia three years ago all by herself to be a professional ballerina in the Estonia Ballet Company. And both her and Rachel are just like elegent and graceful and wonderful. But she was so kind and hospitable and took us to her favorite restaurants and pointed out fun facts while we walked and constantly checked in on how we were doing. And being around them gave such a cool glimpse into the life of professional ballet dancers, which is just so fascinating and challenging and a unique perspective.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We got brunch in the city, and I had wonderful porridge with lingonberries (I love porridge; it is filling, cheap, and wonderful) and a cute little latte. And then we explored Old Town. Estonia is like a magical princess castle land. 
                Beautiful Renaissance architecture with big stone walls and orange towers. It just looks straight out of a storybook. All of the buildings were just so interesting and historical; I swear I could wander around Old Town for days. There was also a Renaissance fair going on, so the streets were filled with old-timey salespeople. And there were so many people with, like, the tiniest little rat dogs. Like they could be carried away by a seagull. Such a city of tiny dogs. Also, the flowers! There were walls of flower stands approaching the market, and all the restaurants had beautiful blooming flowers in the window boxes; it was wonderful.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The views were incredible, and we visited an Orthodox church. There was such a cool fusion between medieval and Russian architecture. There was also a lot of support for Ukraine in banners and protest signs outside the Russian embassy. Estonia was liberated around 100 years ago, so that threat is very real to them. 
                Anyways, the church was just so brightly colored, and there was a ceremony going on inside, so it was completely silent.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We explored a little more and then went to Mia's apartment to drop off bags, which was a blessing to not carry all my possessions or to dump my belongings in a sketchy locker. We walked to a super cool food court where I grabbed Boba and a Kazakhstani cabbage pastry, and then the fire alarm went off, so we just explored. We saw some beautiful hand-sewn dresses, video game stores, zero waste stores. Doubled back to the market, and I grabbed a fridge magnet. I decided I'm a fridge magnet girl. I like souvenirs, but I don't believe in junk, but magnets are like 2 bucks, have a purpose, easy to display, and are fun to collect. 
                We also went to a bookstore in a cute little mall, and we browsed the cool European covers of classic books, and I contemplated buying Moomin merch. I just love him. I will get merch. I am just cheap. I think I will get a mug eventually.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Then we went back home, dropped off junk, ate cinnamon rolls, chatted, charged up phones. Then headed out to a place. It was like the ruins of an important building of some sort, but it looked like the stage for a really cool dystopian fight scene, with cool graffiti over architecture. We walked upstairs and then just sat on the cement ledge and watched the sunset and just talked for like an hour. It was such a pretty view of the ocean, and Old Town and the city, and there was a salty breeze from the sea! My heart just felt full. Then we booked it to the restaurant, and we got burgers on Estonian rye bread buns (literally so good) and lemonade with a bitter orange fruit paste in it. I don't know, it tasted like Finnish Kelpkap. And had a delirious tram/walk back across the city to crash around 1 am. It almost felt like real nighttime. Kinda crazy. A little scary, I forgot night on the streets is not a great time...
            </p>
            
            <p>
                DAY 2!! We're close, guys. We slept in, which was also fantastic to be well-rested for once on a weekend (also did little temporary tattoos because why not?). And we went to a little pancake cafe that was so incredible, like fat ricotta-covered blueberry bacon pancakes. And thick-sliced avocado toast with roasted tomatoes, ricotta, fluffy eggs, and everything bagel seasoning! Those dishes looked like art. Every meal in Estonia was literally so good.
                
                <p>Then we went to a cute summer palace turned art museum. So brightly covered, eachroom in the house was painted in such a bright, vivid shade. And the ballroom was incredible. Like, you just walk in and are in awe. So detailed and wonderful. It makes you want to rewind to the 18th century and dance in a fabulous ball. Maybe social dance next semester... But the art was beautiful and from various collections around Europe. </p>
            I got to take more pictures where my face looks like old portraits, which is lovely. Then we wandered the gardens. Serious Alice in Wonderland vibes; I literally just want to wander the little labyrinths. Visited the Estonian president's pink little villa. The flag was up, and guards were out, so I think he was inside somewhere. Walked through a courtyard symbolizing Dante's Inferno. Then had way too much fun in a rose garden. Literally so many roses, all in bloom and in so many different shades. They smelled incredible and were so lush. Such vibrant and well-designed gardens; we loved it. Stopped at Mia's favorite cafe, and I got myself an Estonian honey cake, tried some marzipan, and sat for a while on the second floor of the cafe. It was just quiet and lovely. Waited out some showers. Checked out a sunken ship monument. Touched the ocean. Swung on some swings. After that, we grabbed our stuff, had one last wander through Old Town, and booked it to the ferry.
            <p>We were pretty dead on the way home; my book is weird, so I spent a while on Instagram Reels. On the train ride home, we got in trouble for not having Finnish student cards, so that stunk. Also, the man across from me kept putting his bare feet on my chair. Yuck. I was not able to sleep much, but now I am showered and at work (not actually doing work yet) and excited to go look through all my photos.</p>
                <p>It was such a magical weekend. Sweet friends, delicious food, and so much beautiful European cityscape to take in. My heart was so full of joy, and I know this will be one of the weekends that I will look back on and treasure for a long time coming. Such a blessing! Thank you, Estonia.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title custom-green">Thoughts on Cheese</h2>
              <p class="card-text">
                <p>I have never liked cheese, although all cheeses are not made equal. Therefore, I have decided to establish formal parameters to categorize my feelings towards specific cheeses and cheese-inclusive dishes. My thoughts:</p>

                <div class="image-container" style="position: relative; display: inline-block;">
                  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.9e0caa8628009f5bb525d1e09604fda9?rik=dI0nOfBy3ahp1w&riu=http%3a%2f%2fvitaitaliantours.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f03%2fNeapolitan-Pizza-Margherita.jpg&ehk=Rk%2bfgzpAHbGig6ZHOExH6bwW62dG29BR4XPCsHqKBSI%3d&risl=1&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="Hello" style="width: 40%;">
                </div>
                <h3>Acceptable:</h3>
                <p>These forms of cheese don't have any particularly strong flavors and just taste like cream. They are normally white in color. Cheeses include mozzarella, ricotta, mascarpone, or cream cheese. To be clear, I am not going to eat these cheeses individually, but I do normally enjoy when they are incorporated into a dish. For example, pizza, lasagna, cheesecake, chicken parm, or tiramisu. Furthermore, if there is a sprinkle of Parmesan or a slice of mozzarella on a sandwich, I have no issues.</p>

                <p>A subset of acceptable cheeses are cheese-based snacks. These include cheese-its, goldfish, and Cheetos. I am not sure why I enjoy them, but I also do not think they taste much like cheese.</p>

                <h3>Stomachable:</h3>
                <p>These are cheeses I have not consumed enough to sort or cheese-based foods I would not make for myself but would eat because I am an adult who can eat foods they do not like. But I normally will choose to remove the cheese if given an easy removal. Enchiladas, cheeseburgers, cheesy/alfredo-dominant pastas, or basically any dish where cheese is a dominant flavor. Also, variations of the cheese-based snacks, i.e., white cheddar Cheetos or gold-whales.</p>

                <h3>Disgusting:</h3>
                <p>Yellow cheese or any dish where cheese is the main flavor. Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, queso, nachos, fondue, cheese omelets. Any cheese with mold on it, blue cheese, or just eating straight cheese.</p>

                <h3>Abominable:</h3>
                <p>Velveeta, squirt cheese, stadium nachos.</p>
                <p>I don't like to think about Velveeta it's texture is just disgusting. Artificially flavored and colored cheese abominations should not exist.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title custom-green">Recipes for Surviving College</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Everyone offers easy meals for college students, but those meals are lies. They assume you have vegetables or staples like milk on hand, or time and the mental capacity to wash more than 3 dishes. These are the meals I have actually fed myself in college, given that I am cheap, go to the store about once every 2.5 weeks, cannot cook well, and have little time. The goal is to make these meals in large batches so each one is like 4 dinners and most use ingredients that are shelf-stable for months or frozen.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Pasta</strong> - This is my main food. Literally any pasta (I like linguini) and any sauce (marinara, pesto, vodka sauce), and if you have chicken, you can throw in some chicken or frozen meatballs. Can make it all in one pot, takes like 20 minutes, can make like 4 dinners.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Lentils</strong> - It's kinda like a bean soup. I just throw lentils and water in a pot with some random seasonings, make sure the lentils are under a layer of water and add water if it cooks off. If you are bougie, you can use chicken broth or add sausage, but I normally do not. I just let it sit until it is mush can take like an hour but you don't have to do anything. You can also throw some rice in the rice cooker and eat them together.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Baked Veggies/Chicken</strong> - If you want veggies, I just cut up like a zucchini, potato, carrots, or anything that will roast and put it on a pan, cover it in olive oil and Italian seasoning, and throw it in the oven at like 400 degrees until it looks roasted. Can also roast chicken if you have it, and you have a full healthy meal.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Chicken and Squash</strong> - This is my fancy dish because normally you do need to have gone to the store to have chicken. Cut like 3 chicken breasts into small chunks and put in a pan with water. Cook until the water is gone; this means it is probably safe to consume. Then dump like 2-3 squash cut into chunks and dump Italian dressing to taste (I normally drown it). Then cook until mush. Will probably take like an hour, but I like goulash texture.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Rice and Egg Dish</strong> - Dump rice (per package instructions) into a rice cooker, dump in frozen broccoli, and cook until like mostly done. Then crack an egg in there and add some soy sauce. Then let it cook until done. Then eat your eggs, chicken veggie rice out of the rice cooker. Healthy, takes like 20 minutes, and if you eat it out of the rice cooker you only wash one dish.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Literally Just Eggs</strong> - Make eggs. Eat on toast with jam if bread available; otherwise, just eat your eggs. Normally, this meal means I need to go to the store soon.</p>
              
              <p><strong>TikTok Ramen</strong> - This recipe is from my dad, and it is delicious. Basically, boil some water in a kettle/microwave and dump it on the ramen noodles in a little bowl (you can eat out of this bowl later for fewer dishes). Then, in a pan, mix brown sugar/syrup/honey with garlic and soy sauce to get a sauce. Just guess on all the ratios and add them until it tastes good. Also, add a sprinkle of whatever seasoning came with the ramen. Then add noodles (not the water) from the bowl and mix/cook until it looks like ramen. Make a little space on your pan and scramble an egg and then mix it all up. Dump some into a bowl and sprinkle everything bagel seasoning over it. Yum. This normally makes like 2 meals for me but only takes like 10 minutes.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Mashed Potatoes and Chili</strong> - Buy instant mashed potatoes and canned chili, costs like 2 bucks. Add boiling water to mashed potatoes and heat chili in a pot over the stove. Dump together in one big bowl and mix. Eat. Makes like 4 meals, not a classy dinner but it's so easy.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Frozen Chicken Nuggets/Frozen Taters/Frozen Pizza</strong> - Cheap and easy sustenance, it's not like healthy, but it's a nice easy meal to keep in reserve. Also, I recommend red bag chicken from Aldi, it is my favorite.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Lunch:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sandwiches</strong> - heavily dependent on having bread (I normally do not). But PB and J is a classic. You can splurge and get some deli meat and make some pesto sandwiches/paninis if you have a press. Delicious.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Guac, Hummus, Chips</strong> - This is my standard packed lunch. All can be purchased in bulk from SAMS and last like 2.5 months in the fridge. Throw one of each into lunch in the morning and use chips to eat the others. Kinda weird but tastes good. I also normally add a trail mix, also in bulk from SAMS.</p>
        
              <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Overnight Oats/Porridge</strong> - can be made in bulk in like 10 minutes. I just mix oats, peanut butter, honey, almond milk, chia seeds (just use whatever is in your pantry) in Tupperware and stick it in the fridge. As far as ratios, just make sure the oats are swimming in liquid and it should taste fine. I just grab a spoon and eat like a fifth of it each morning. Gets you through a week and is healthy-ish.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Handful of Granola and Greek Yogurt</strong> - similar to overnight oats, you do not need a bowl. Yogurt lasts forever in the fridge.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Toast</strong> - if time you can toast it and add peanut butter. Otherwise, it is just bread. It is nice because you can eat it on your way to class.</p>

              <h2 class="card-title custom-green">Roman Holiday pt. 1</h2>
              <p class="card-text">This vacation is sponsored by Davide for letting us take like 3 days off of work. Also I just wrote all my thoughts each day, so there is kinda a lot of content, whoops :) </p> <p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
              <p>Dang, it is so gorgeous here. Like hot and humid but wonderful. I've had a sheen of sticky sweat on my skin since I left the airport, and it's not going anywhere. But you just walk around through twisting cobblestone streets, and you turn the corner, and like bam, landmark. Cool church, pillars, fountains. Like these aren't even the good landmarks, and they are so cool. The soundtrack of the city is me saying, 'Look, a cool thing.' We popped into a French cathedral, and it was stunning, like free and overlooked but wonderful. Speaking of cobblestone streets, I think I almost got hit by every driving vehicle you can think of: car, motorcycle, Vespa, bus, tram, scooter person, bicycle person. The roads are insane. Sergio (On the research team, lives in Rome, our volunteer tour guide) drove us around while blasting The Weekend with the windows down, and it was a vibe, also felt like a video game. I ate so much bread in general. Italian travel is a literal feast. Literally, everywhere we go, Sergio is like, 'Do you want a snack?' and then takes us somewhere, which is like a huge amount of food, and we're like, 'Sergio, we need to be hungry for dinner later.' We did stop for a snack, which was aperitivo, or like 2 charcuterie plates of prosciutto and ham and cheese and bread and honey. Made little bread/ham sandwiches, they were lit. Also had the Italian Sprite, which was sparkling water and lemon, it was actually so refreshing, it was called Shweppes or something. Dinner later was the pasta gricia and amatriciana Which is basically pasta, pecorino cheese, black pepper, and bacon, and then the other one just has tomato. It was so fresh; the woman inside was still rolling it out; it was cooked immediately. So good. And we had cute little Aperol Spritz, which I still think tastes like DayQuil, but it was a vibe. Sergio wanted to party, but we wanted to rest our legs, so inside we went home.</p>
              <p>As far as our walking tour of Rome, we hit a lot of the highlights. We saw a palace thing, courthouse, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, some cool churches. Took lots of pictures, but everything was swamped with tourists, like Disney but historical and insane. Sergio had some cool tricks and took us to a store that overlooks Trevi Fountain so we could get pictures of that and took us to one of his favorite buildings, which was beautifully painted inside, which was wonderful.</p>
              <p>He also pointed out gelato places and cool food places. He also took us to the best espresso place in Rome. It was actually so good, but I embarrassed myself trying to drink espresso like an Italian; it's just a shot, but the glass is warm to make better crema, and I literally burned my mouth and also got it all over my face... rip but I tried, and it was delicious though, such a well balanced shot and like super rich. We also walked down to the Colosseum, and he took us up an escalator where we could take really cute pictures and also got our little metro cards. Walked through some cool ruins, saw a huge white building built by Mussolini. But that was day one, ate some pasta, explored Rome, discovered the land of tourism, and hung out with Sergio.</p>
              <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
              <p>Today was an adventure. We got up early to go to like a secret place Sergio told us to get Colosseum/Roman Forum tickets. It did not work, so we waited in the big line. It looked like an hour twenty, and there were constant hawkers being like, 'I can get you in now for 50 euros,' or 'cold water,' or 'fans.' It was hot, but we played some guess the song, and it went by. Then we grabbed a gas station pastry (powdery sugary, creamy, flaky deliciousness) and went to the Colosseum. It was incredible.</p>
              <p>Like so big and old. It's crazy how long it's been there, like through 2 earthquakes, being harvested for iron, and all of the Middle Ages. It was actually preserved because popes had it declared a monument to the loss of Christian martyrs. It was also such a feat of engineering, like the mechanisms just used to raise and lower animals and things into the games are literally so complex, and the whole thing is just 20-50 ton stones built on top of each other. It was beautiful and ancient and huge. Just crazy to think about. After that, we got lunch because we were feeling a little hangry. Sergio told us a carbonara place to go to, but they were closed until dinner, so we explored some shops and then ate at a random place. We split some carbonara, and it was literally so good! We returned to the Roman Forum to explore. It was beautiful but also veeeery hot, like Ernesto had 6 low blood sugar episodes, and I was a little delirious from heat. But we paid an extra 5€ for an extended experience, which actually meant we got to walk into like 3 little museums, but they were air-conditioned museums, so that was very, very needed.</p>
              <p>And then finally escaped the gardens around 5, literally dying from the heat. Immediately, we went and got some gas station gelato; I got pistachio and tiramisu, and it was literally so good. And it melted instantly. Needed to kill some time, so we walked over to the monument built by Mussolini; it is so huge and has so many layers of white stones and columns and everything, with winged horses and statues and a flame and a tomb of an unknown soldier. I just wanted to slide across the marble floors, and the views were incredible.</p>
              <p>We made it to the top and found an elevator to the very top for like 3€. Probably the best view in Rome. You could see the whole city; it was so cool. Then hung out on the rooftop, watched some birds attack people. Walked to dinner. Attempted to find the mouth of truth, found it, but it was locked up :( then walked to the Trastevere district for a dinner place from Sergio; it was soooo good!! It definitely felt more hipster, and there was some cool Catholic-inspired graffiti. Split two pizzas, ate an incredible Nutella ricotta calzone (gave Nutella colache), then we were literally dead, so we went home and got rest rather than going to an Italian '90s disco with Sergio. Pizza was literally just bread with prosciutto on it, but it hit. The room was a little stagnant, but we showered and got ready for bed. Luckily, Rachel was kind and let me get the bed by the fan because that fan is my joy. I just wait for it to swing back to me; I try to sleep with none of my limbs touching, or else the sweat pools. You leave the shower, and a film of sweat begins to form. Also, mosquitoes eat me in my sleep, but I'm not closing the window, I need it.</p>

                <p><strong>Day 3:</strong></p>
                    <p>Today is Vatican day also my favorite day, left at 7 for the basilica. Blisters and sunburn are real. Also fashioned my creation aka the dress-skirt, it gets the job done and meets cathedral requirements.</p>
                    <p>We queued for maybe 10 minutes and then got to go inside. The whole entrance is just white columns and fountains and is beautiful. And inside is just so ostentatious, like intricate gold ceilings, crazy statues, paintings and each dome/alcove was beautiful and intricate and wonderful. You could spend hours there and the space is just so grand and open. We also saw a little alcove made by Donatello. And some pope bodies under glass. It was cooool. And freee.</p>
                    <p>We were hungry again so hit up a restaurant and I ordered a cappuccino and a cannoli (definitely better than an American cannoli, idk how the cream was cold and the orange was warm, it was pretty fantastic would recommend). Then we walked to the Parthenon which was wonderful because I feel like I got a lot of bang for my buck. Waited like maybe 15 minutes and then got in for 5€. It was also so beautiful, like the biggest concrete dome ceiling in the world, a perfect sphere, and no one knows how it was constructed, it's an archaeological marvel.</p>
                    <p> We stopped outside to get a frozen coffee thing which is super popular with Italians and tasted like a frosty but with super high-quality espresso. Then walked to the Trevi Fountain, it was beautiful, stuck my hand in, swamped with tourists… then walked to the Spanish Steps. Ernesto didn't do this one because we were reaching death heat. We climbed the steps and went into a cute little cathedral at the top where we had to catch our breaths because dang it was hot. Then we went to an expensive lunch place; they brought us 3 waters and each was like 4 bucks, what even. But there was AC which was the main appeal. Took a subway across the city where we waited for our tour (I booked the tickets with escorted entrance literally while waiting in line for the Colosseum yesterday, they were definitely a win, probably would have gotten heat stroke otherwise...) We got there like an hour early, but we just wanted to be in a building. AND THEY LET US IN EARLY!! What a blessing! I don't know why, but I am grateful! There was a poor girl there in tears because her wallet got stolen from the Colosseum (don't bring a tote bag to Rome), poor thing. And then we explored the Vatican Museums. I was most surprised that the museum was as beautiful as the artwork inside it with intricate ceilings and statues and history. Some highlights: Rafael's Transcendence, the MAP room, the sculpture hallways, Perseus, the pine cone! There was so much beautiful things to look at that you become desensitized. Like any one of those rooms could be its own exhibit and at that point was just like wow it's all so cool. Like downloading art and history into your brain for like 3 hours and afterwards, you're just like fried. There was a Picasso where he painted himself as Jesus and it was just shoved in a side room where none of the tours even went! The Sistine Chapel was also incredible like we were breaking our necks staring up at the ceiling. The room was packed with people and there was a no photography rule, but everyone took a little secret pic of the creation of Adam because like dang.</p>
                    <p>Idk how he made that, some of the people looked so realistic that they could fall off the walls. Stopped at a restaurant outside our Airbnb that is always packed and got some food. Rachel and I split a lasagna and pizza and that might have been the best lasagna I've had, it was incredible. Had a bite of Ernesto's Tiramisu also really good and Rachel and I split a cream puff. I also got a peach Bellini and it was actually so delicious, I love peach juice, big fan. Much better than the Aperol Spritz. Finished off the meal with a complementary cookie and shot of Limoncello… tasted like alcohol, but like really lemony fun alcohol, would recommend. Kinda like a bitter lemon cake exploding in your mouth. We took two sips and then downed it. Then walked home and showered, ahh the feeling of not being covered in sweat is addicting. I never wanted to leave that shower. I also discovered that mosquitoes have been eating my legs while I sleep. My legs have been devoured, but I can't put on a blanket because it is too hot. I struggle for sleep because I was paranoid about my exposed legs, like a feast just waiting for the mosquitoes. They did eat my legs, but I survived.</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 4:</strong></p>
                    <p>We’re going to Florence!! Our goals are David, Duomo, and visiting Morgan!! but very exciting and a little bit expensive… but when in Italy we might as well. We spent the morning on a high speed train (as in 250 km/h) through the Italian countryside and it is beautiful!! Mountains, rolling fields, vineyards, bright yellow flowers!! It is so beautiful I could just stare out the window all day! And we are crossing a lot of Italy which is so cool! I could live here, it would be wonderful. Also train is lowkey like an airplane, cushy, they gave us snacks, I am a big fan. We went to duomo which is a cool big dome cathedral, my big oops is that legs have to be covered and I was not aware so we were not able to go inside :( I think it was closed on Sundays anyways, but still not fun. Went to the museum, then met up with Morgan!! Yayy! Got to hear about her experiences in Italy! She took us to a market and a boar you must touch to return to Italy, we also saw a piazza/palace thing and a cool sculpture garden and painted roof. Then we got pizza with a really friendly Italian chef who is famous in South Korea, great pizza and fun vibes. Also had pesca, it is peach juice and it is delicious, like fantastic, I wish it was offered more in America.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then we stopped for gelato. I got biscuit flavored and it was actually incredibly, or I was just hot and sweaty… and then we hiked up a hill to an overlook of the city, it was beautiful, saw some mountains and hills and so many tiny houses and a cool old wall!! And the grave of Michealangelo. Bought a fridge magnet, and headed down the mountain. Stopped at a store to cool off and got some lemon slushie, it has a fancy name, but was perfect. Then we went to see David. They only let 200 people in the gallery so the lines were intense, we also only had 2.5 hours so we’re cutting it close, I think I can get in but who knows, in line right now, sweating, but prayfully we make the cut :) WE MADE IT. David was so cool! Like I’m had no idea how big this guy is, like the details and the veins and his face, he is just like beautiful and so well sculpted and wonderful. We also got to see some other Michelangelo unfinished pieces, a ton of plaster sculptures, some alter pieces. Also as a side note all the tourist marketing for this city is like Duomo, David and The creation of Venus. There’s also like a ton of memorabilia for David’s junk, like magnets, post cards, t-shirts, also his butt, it’s just interesting. But we hoofed it to the train station and now we get to SIT in AC it’s the little things :) Sergio texted to go out again, and Ernesto said he would go because Sergio had been a really great tour guide and I felt bad, I also joined. He picked us up, blasted some TSwift and we got a drink downtown, walked around a little bit, ate an epic fried rice ball with like mozarella and tomato in the middle and then dropped us off at home, We chatted with Franchesca (airbnb owner) in some English, Spanish, Italian mix and she offered to let us drop our stuff at her place for the morning. But I was dead tired so I showered and went to bed. At this point i have fully surrendered to be eaten by the mosquitoes each night. I was more tired so slept great!</p>

                    <p><strong>Day 5:</strong></p>
                    <p>We slept in and most places were closed, so it was a chill morning. Took the bus to the Campelli Museum, which was pretty great. Unfortunately, when we got on the bus and scanned our tickets, mine and Ernesto's did not scan properly. So some guys came on the bus and scanned everyone's card. There were like 7 of us who had issues and we all got charged a fine. Which was just awful. No fun. I haaaaate getting stupid fines, they literally overcomplicate their transfer so they can profit off of tourists, just kinda stinky. The museum was cool though, there was a plaza designed by Michelangelo and some cool statues and a really famous Lupa suckling Romulus and Remus from like BCE, which was pretty epic. We decided to head out early and start navigating our way to the airport because public transport always takes longer than you expect… also need to get lunch. We stopped at a place called EATALY, which kinda gives IKEA vibes but is like a super grocery store with food from all over Italy. Got some epic pesto pasta and an orange that was literally so good and juicy. Caught the train from there to the airport and then blazed through security, didn't even have to take anything out of my bags. Then sat around at some chairs with chargers, migrated over to the gate, got some pizza and a really good lemon soda, flew back home. Arrived in Helsinki, we found some chairs tucked away with a charger and alternated sleeping and sitting on our phones before flying out at like 6. Then bused, walked, and finally got home to take a shower and be blessedly sweat-free. So Rome is concluded, it was a really cool and magical city but also 5 days of heat and intense travel, so feeling blessed I got to spend 5 days in Rome, but also excited to sleep in a bed tonight and make my own food :)</p>

                <body>
                <p>The Enneagram and Taylor Swift are two fields in which I have unknowingly gained vast amounts of knowledge. For these reasons, I will be combining them into one "enneagram," but with albums instead of numbers. Enjoy:</p>
                
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Speak Now</strong> - This is a confident album by a self-assured young artist who knows her worth. It has emotions, but is not overwhelmed by them, and seems much more controlled and directed. Songs like "Speak Now," "Mine," and "Enchanted" show a Taylor who has strong emotions, but more importantly, knows what she wants and will interrupt a wedding to get it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lover</strong> - This album is a sweet ode to romance. I feel like it fits sweet, loving twos who just want to make those around them happy. Songs like "Lover," "Cornelia Street," and "Daylight" fit the unobtrusive, romanticizing threes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Midnights</strong> - This album shows work, grind, and more of the schemy side of Taylor than other albums. Songs like "Mastermind," "You're On Your Own Kid," "Bejeweled," and "Karma" suit an older, less emotional Taylor, who is defined by her long career as a pop icon rather than by her romantic feelings. It shows Taylor's emotional side, but in a more controlled way, rather than some other albums that overflow with emotion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Red</strong> - This album is a roller coaster of emotions from joy to heartbreak and is very focused on relationships. It fits emotional, relationship-centered fours. Songs like "All Too Well," "Stay Stay Stay," and "State of Grace" suit the range of emotions fours feel, but also that emotions are a dominating force in the album.

                    <strong>Folklore</strong> - This is Taylor's dive into poetry and introspection, not as fiery as the other albums, but suits the quieter, more introspective fives who would love to take a deep dive into folklore and songwriting. Songs like "The Last Great American Dynasty," "Seven," and "Betty" show a desire for storytelling and a passion that comes more from the stories than from personal hurt or emotions.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Fearless</strong> - This is a weaker comparison, as sixes are definitely not fearless, but they are more insecure and seek security, and this album does seem more insecure than other Taylor Swift albums. It showcases commitment and loyalty, some anxiety, and overthinking, but most importantly, Taylor is seeking security in this album through relationships. Songs like "White Horse" and "Forever and Always" showcase overthinking, while trust issues are more at the center of songs like "The Way I Loved You" and "You Belong With Me."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>1989</strong> - This album feels extraverted, stylish, and energetic. It is about exploring new cities and new relationships. It suits the playful and energetic extroversion of sevens, along with their darker fears and more irrational behavior. Songs like "Style," "Shake It Off," and "Welcome to New York" show the fun-filled, new experience-driven sevens. While darker songs like "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" show the dark side of the flighty sevens.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Reputation</strong> - Eights are not afraid of conflict. When challenged, they would say "Look What You Made Me Do." Confident, unashamed, and strong, this one seems to explain itself pretty well. Some songs that fit eights are "Don't Blame Me," "I Did Something Bad," "Call It What You Want," and "Ready For It."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Evermore</strong> - This album feels ethereal and dreamy. It feels exempt from the heartbreak and rage that fill other albums. It suits the conflict-averse nines. Songs like "Right Where You Left Me," "Dorothea," and "Willow" fit nines as it has more of a focus on the person of the story than the singer, who seems to stake through all these tales and follow the lead of the characters in each tale.

                <h4>Day 1:</h4>
                <p>
                    Today was mostly a travel day with nothing more exciting than drinking some classic Finnair blueberry juice and reading my book, which is called <em>Fairytale</em>, and it’s pretty cool. My first perception of Copenhagen is that it's such an aesthetically pleasing city, but dang, things are gonna be expensive. The Denmark currency is like one 6th of American money, which makes figuring out how much things cost awful. Sweden was easy because it was a 10th, so you just add a decimal, but this is already confusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hopped on a really cute little train and trained our way to the Airbnb. The train stations all have urban garden vibes with clean lines, black metal, and lots of greenery. Definitely the nicest metro I’ve used. Then we got to the Airbnb, which was sooo cute. It's like our own little apartment all to ourselves for like 30 a night!! There was a kitchen with Moomin mugs! And the tiniest little bathroom where the shower sprays onto the toilet. We decided to get some food, so we walked to a pizza place and got two pizzas for like 10€ each. The American one was shredded ham and strips of bacon, while the other one was pepperoni, shawarma, and yogurt sauce; both were delicious. So we took them back and ate in our dining room and drank a soda that came with them. It tasted like sprite but more candy. Then we retired to bed.
                </p>
            
                <h4>Day 2:</h4>
                <p>
                    Woke up at 7 with the sun in my eyes because of the window. Broke into the coffee and French-pressed myself some to drink. Then I just stood in the kitchen and drank my Moomin mug of coffee and looked out the window. The vibes were just really good. In Rome, I loved the history, but here I love the aesthetic. It is wonderful.
                </p>
                <p>Grabbed a metro pass which is probably over priced but it will get us around for two days! And then metroed over to down town. The metro system is great here, online, clean, and downtown the lines run like every 4 minutes. Love the metro. Don’t love the price. The metro literally popped out right in front of Fredricks church which was pretty cool, it gave scare hall from monsters U. We walked to a little coffee shop near by because it wasn’t open yet and got some breakfast, which was a poppyseed cinnamon roll thing, it was pretty crumbly and delicious, then explored the church. Lots of red marble and dark stone, it was really pretty and there was a cool paintings of the apostles on the dome. Then explored in the direction of Chritiansomething palace. The streets are just beautiful, so much white and teal and orange rooftops. It’s just so cute. The soundtrack of Copenhagen is it just me saying "look that is so cute" like a million times. Saw a cute street where all the famous photos are taken. Stepped into a little church, all yellow and marble. Then decided to get a tour of the palace. So pretty!! We saw gold and velvet receiving rooms. Our dream beauty and the beast library. A green and gold Baylor room. And a room with like modern tapestries with JFK on them. It was cool. We also had little hairnets on our shoes so it was fun to skate around all the fancy floors. Then it was raining but we popped into a little garden, that was beautiful. Then metroed back across town. We meandered around a park that was the remains of an old castle fort. It was star shaped, there was a cool wind mill. Then walked around the pier to see the little mermaid… she was small. But cool. Very magestic and with like 3 double decker tour buses on either side. Saw a seaplane noodling around the harbor, saw a magestic fountain with like oxes being driven through a river. Got sprinkled on again. Visited Amailienburg palace but missed the changing of the guards :( we’ll be back. Then got overpriced sandwhiches. They were good, chicken pesto on homemade bread, but still. Then wakes to round tower, saw a church, took a long ramp up to the top. The explored kings gardens, literally so beautiful. Felt like straight out of a period piece and had families lounging and picknicking around. Visited Rothansjbd palace. Then split and went home, we metroed, the boys biked. It rained hard. Then took a nap break at the Airbnb and charged up the phones. Got dinner at a cafe nearby, also expensive. But got a pretty epic chicken sandwich, it was huge, mage a huge mess. And elderflower juice which tastes like lychee and is sooo good, and like native to Denmark, I am a big fan, then went home and went to bed. </p>

                <h4>Day 3:</h4>
                <p>
                    We closed the blinds, so we slept a lot better. Got up, finished off my now cold brew coffee. Took the train to get breakfast. We went to Grod, which is like a trendy porridge place, and it was incredible. I got an all-toppings porridge, and it had so many toppings: strawberries, banana, caramel sauce, granola, all kinds of nuts, chocolate. It was so good, and I was so full afterwards. Can America please make trendy porridge a thing?

                <p>
                    Explored the botanical gardens, which were free and absolutely beautiful, with so many fat little bumblebees and purple flowers. Rachel loves flowers, so it was a good day. Then we headed over to Amalienborg Palace to see the changing of the guards, and we got a good view. They did a little circle, then stared at each other for like 5 minutes. We left, picked up a fridge magnet, and took the iconic houses' picture for Denmark. Decided to get a hotdog because it's the only food under $10 in this cursed country, and then headed to Tivoli Gardens. It was beautiful, with super well-cultivated gardens and little buildings, really felt like pre-Disney. Unfortunately, it was pretty drizzly. Went into the tiniest one-room aquariums, saw some cute little fishies. Went on "the demon," an Asian-inspired roller coaster that was actually pretty epic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we wandered the park in the rain, stopped to watch a pantomime, which was a surprisingly epic fairytale opera about a tin soldier and a ballerina. They both end up thrown into the furnace at the end, so pretty tragic. But it was cool; we stood in the rain for like half an hour to watch the show, then took shelter in a cafe to sit and dry off, and I got a little Irish cream latte, it was delicious. Then we decided to stop by 7-Eleven for some dinner snacks and took the metro home. Then we rested and hid from the rain for the evening before having a leftover pizza feast.
                </p>

                <h4>Day 4:</h4>
                <p>
                    We got up early to take our last metro into the city on our metro pass. We metroed like 10 minutes overtime, but no one caught us! Yayyy. We were on a quest to get Danishes. We walked forever, but it was Josef's day, and I didn't have to navigate, so I was happy. Got to a cute little bakery with a bunch of parents and kiddos. Grabbed some Danishes. They were like $5 and actually so good, definitely the best Danish I've ever had. We sat and chatted and listed types of birds and then set off on a quest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On our way, we passed a bunch of parents walking with their kids; it was adorable, and there was a two-year-old on a baby bike, shredding it in a skate park. He was much more talented than I could be. But we continued on our way to get to Freetown Christiania, an independent community inside Copenhagen. I was a little nervous because travel people were like don't go there at night and don't take pictures because other travelers have been mugged for taking pictures. But we got there, and elderly couples and children were going inside, so it felt pretty safe :) There was crazy and funky graffiti on everything, and the people there definitely looked a little hippy. They sold bracelets and linen dresses in one section, and in another section, they just sold marijuana. It looked like lemonade stands with spray-painted wooden tables/stalls, each with some pun about weed on the top board to identify the shop. We watched someone buy some weed, wandered a little deeper into a foresty area, and then the boys bought some souvenirs (not weed), and we walked onwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crossed a bridge that was being lowered for ships and ended up in Nyhavn, the touristy area. Took some cute pics and went out for lunch. Found a place that had only 2 options of falafel and kebab; it was sooo delicious. Rachel and I split because we're cheap and people didn't finish their fries, so I took a travel cup with my truffle mayo and ate it while we walked. Passed a dog drying outside a store, it was sad. Trained back home, and then packed to leave. Trained back to the airport. The Copenhagen airport just has good vibes. There aren't many workers, just informative signs. A little sign tells you to wait and then which lane to go into; a little video tells you to bag liquids. Super easy process, and the inside of the airport is like a shopping mall. We crashed at an abandoned gate while we waited for our gate to be assigned. Then some people in matching athleisure showed up and filled in some of the seats. They had a camera, and they kept coming. Soon the whole gate was just this football team with us awkwardly sitting in the very middle. They are called FC København and have like 225k Instagram followers. It was pretty cool. Then we found our actual gate and an outlet!! And I enjoyed the wifi/outlet life. Looking forward to some blueberry juice.

                    Also tangent: bathrooms! A lot are coed, which surprised me, but it didn't feel super weird because the stalls felt like their own secure rooms. No bidets like Finland, but still eco-toilets and single-use toilet sheets rather than just an infinite roll.
