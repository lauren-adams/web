        <p>My Review: This was such a great book!! I loved the Martian so I was excited to get back to science filled Sci-fi and sarcastic lonely adventures in space. But this book was so good! The multiple story arcs of the past and the present!! ROCKY!! Idk it was just so sweet and smart and kinda wholesome :) I don't know if I like it more that the Martian it just felt a lot more heartfelt. Anyways I don't know how Weir is able to write like that and know so much about space and math and language and all of the things, but it was such a great book! Would recommend! 8.5</p>

        <p>My Review: I loved this book, I also just love a good WW2 book. After reading four winds it was remarkably similar with just the themes of like family and perseverance and motherhood and some of the plot elements. But I liked how it used each sister to showcase different aspects and headships of life under occupation and the fight for resistance. I also really enjoyed the time jumps to one of the sisters much later in life, I thought it added a little bit of mystery and tension of who is it. Anyways I enjoyed it, it made my sad on my train ride when I was finishing it. Good read 8</p>

        <p>My Review: This book took a little bit to get into but was super great!! At the beginning Elsa annoyed me and it just felt super slow, so I just didn' want to get back to reading itâ€¦ but once the dust bowl kicked into gear it got super interesting! It was just another little piece of history that I hadn' thought about, but such a sweet story about family and perseverance. I was even a little emotional at the end, historical fiction gets to me :) so unexpectedly great book! 7.8</p>

        <p>Date Read: 2023-06-18 00:00:00</p>
        <p>My Review: My thoughts on this book are very similar to the previous ones. Rin is the worst, it is really interesting but graphically violent, love the history stuff, and everything would be better if they just listened to Kitay. I was pretty frustrated at the ending, like I get why it had to happen, but also it did feel like a really big turn around from Rins previous character development/insanity arc. Also I did not totally understand the love/hate romance thing it didn' feel super well explained. Other than those things it was a pretty epic war book, I loved the trifecta and Daji and the return of Jiang. Good book 7.8</p>

        <p>My Review: This was also a book that was hard to put down, and I liked it even better than the first one. I love the history tie ins that just taught me how little I know about Chinese history, but I felt like I learned a lot. It's  hard to root for Rin because she is an unrepentant mass murderer, but at least Kitay got more screen time, because he is my favorite. I also loved the Cike, they were such a squad. I also loved the Hesparian/colonization plot lines and the more serious consequences of war, it helped group a little more of the insane parts of the last book. Overall it was a lot  and very intense but a good read. 8.4</p>

        <p>Date Read: 2023-06-08 00:00:00</p>
        <p>My Review: I was not expecting to enjoy this book very much, I just picked it up because I recognized the cover. It is a fantasy retelling of China's history around WW2 covering the opium wars and the Sion-Chinese wars during WW2, with a little bit of magic and some really cool world building thrown in. There were parts of it that were just graphically and horribly violent, and made me think why am reading this, like this is so intense. But afterwards I learned that the violent atrocities were taken direct from accounts of the Rape of Nanjing and some other historical events in the Sino-Chinese wars. This is not a fun read or a light read, but it is a really great read and it really makes you think about a part of history we normally try not to think about. The characters make some stupid decisions, so that gets on my nerves sometimes, but they are enduring horrible war conditions so I guess they can make bad decisions. Anyways, it was dark, but I couldn't put it down and it's a really beautiful way at looking at the dark truths of war. 8.3</p>

        <p>Date Read: 2023-06-06 00:00:00</p>
        <p>My Review: This was such a great book! I was expecting kinda like a Mere Christianity or like a historical context book but it was much more like a devotional of the Gospel Mark. You can really see that it was derived from a sermon series. I've read the gospels but I've never done a Bible study on them, so this was such a great example of applying and extrapolating theology from the text. I felt that it was a really good introduction to Christianity that used the gospels to tell the good news as they were intended to do. I also have struggled before to get into Tim Keller books because I'm bad at non-fiction, but I really enjoyed this one!! 8</p>

        <p>My Review: Wow I absolutely loved this book! Maybe I just love Dolly Parton, but it made a couple hours of driving fly by. I've also never considered myself to be a big fan of thrillers or James Patterson, so I felt like this was a nice starter thriller that was mostly about music and stardom and love and just a little bit about thriller at the end. Loved all the characters, especially Ruthanna Ryder, but maybe I just love Dolly Parton. Also the audio book version was literally such a great recording. My favorite part was that Dolly released the Run Rose Run album where we actually produced and recorded the songs in the book! It is literally so cool to be able to listen to a book about song writing and then actually listen to the songs, and the songs are like actually so good. (I recommend Woman Up (and take it like a man)) Anyways you could definitely tell Dolly put her heart into this book, and it was fantastic!! My Rating 8:5.</p>

        <p>My Review: Second book was not as good, still tore through it though. There were just too many bad decisions being made, they walked into every single trap they saw, foolish. It was also like super dark, probably like 600 people were described as being killed throughout the novel. Like I get it you're fighting the monsters and the monsters are bad but like super super dark. Idk it flowed great though and was a compelling read, just unnecessarily bloody. 6.4</p>

        <p>My Review: Wow I really enjoyed this book and tore through it in about a day, whenever I had to do other things I just wanted to get back to the book. I felt like I struggled to get into Ninth house but once I finished it it literally couldn't wait to read Hell Bent, and I feel like the flow was just a lot better once you understood the vibe of magical Yale, and the characters and all of the relationships. Loved the cover art, loved the concept, and loved the twists, I definitely didn't expect how it all went down but it fell very real and like there were real consequences for their actions which is surprising considering they spent most of the book trying to open a portal to Hell. I also loved that we got to see more into the backstories of other characters, since a lot of the backstory was revealed in ninth house I was glad that there was more depth to see and I also loved getting to see more of Turners backstory. Sad I have to wait a year or so for the next book, I will definitely forget everything :( Anyways great read, pretty dark, but super fun and definitely engaging. 8.5</p>

        <p>My Review: Hmm idk how I feel about this one, it was a really cool metaphor and kinda reminded me of the silent planet with all of the otherworldly imagery. But definitely not my favorite CS Lewis book. I think it was just a little too weird and had a lot to do with purgatory which is something me and CS Lewis do not have the same opinions about. I think it made some cool points about different sins blind us and how people can willingly choose to not follow God despite having all of the evidence. But also a lot of the characters felt like very unrealistic caricatures, which I guess is the point, but it felt like an oversimplification. Anyways, super interesting book and definitely left me with a lot to think about, but not my favorite. 7.5</p>

        <p>My Review: Hmm this was a weird one. I love Bardugo and all of her other books but this is a much darker and grittier tale. Kind of like a magical thriller set in the secret societies of Yale. I audiobooked it so I got a little confused with the locations and societies, but turns out they are all real places and organizations on Yales campus which is super cool. I'm not much of a thriller  person but I do like a good murder mystery and this one was pretty twisty and kept me guessing. I did get bored so I kinda trudged through the beginning of it. But the ending was pretty fantastic and I can't wait to start the second book. So super weird and dark, but I like it! 7.8</p>

        <p>Date Read: 2023-05-18 00:00:00</p>
        <p>My Review: It was a fun and easy read. I mean it's Rick Riordan so it's gonna be funny and interesting and well written. It is definitely a book for fans rather than newcomers, as it dealt a lot Nicos backstory and PTSD there were a lot of references to things that I did not particularly remember despite reading all 15 books before this one in the past couple years. It also felt a lot more fantasy based than previous books as it was set entirely in Tartarus rather than really intersecting with the real world. And Nico and Will are not really characters I was super attached to, but it was sweet to see them developed a little more throughly and I love the idea of one off adventures rather than full series. I would rank this book in the bottom 25% of Rick Riordan content I have consumed, alongside trials of Apollo, like it was a fun read from a world I am super familiar with, but I'm not gonna want to reread it or think much about it after writing this review. 7 </p>

        <p>My Review: Such a perfect murder mystery. A dark and thrilling story that will leave you questioning everything and scared to be alone in the dark. This was such a short and engaging read. Normally I get a little bored in the middle of a mystery but this one was literally action packed, with gristly deaths at each turn. I loved how it used the structure of the poem, so that you knew what to expect, but we're still surprised and entertained each time. I literally had no idea about the ending, but it so perfectly fulfilled the themes running throughout the book and was throughly unexpected. In summary I love this book, would definitely recommend especially as an intro to the genre and because the ending is less well known the like murder on the orient. </p>

Some of the stories I would finish and then immediately look up an analysis because they were just so perplexing! Some of my favorites were: Philomel Cottage, the second gong, and Witness to the prosecution. Also most of the stories had to do with the supernatural or some kind of con, which was a fun twist! Would recommend!</p>

        <p>My Review: Another classic Agatha Christie read, it was very different than the previous murder mysteries and much more like a missing person thriller. Because of the different set up, the list of potential suspects was shortened making the twist a little bit easier to predict. More political and adventure filled, but a little slow at times.

It is about an announced attempt to kill an elderly woman and the combined efforts of a young detective and Agatha Christie's Mrs. Marple attempt to solve it. I did not expect to be actually sad when characters died nor did I expect to be thoroughly bamboozled by the ending, all the clues were masterfully presented but hidden in seemingly mundane accounts of rural life in the English countryside.

        <p>My Review: I enjoyed this book a lot, it was borrowed from a friend, so not my usual choice of novel but such a sweet and very real feeling coming of age story. All the characters felt very real and layered, if I could use a better ranking system it would be a 7.</p>
